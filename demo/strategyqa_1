            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. The stem of the sentence is Queen Elizabeth, burial, pantheon. Inference: First, the Pantheon is a church, so it's possible that she could be buried there. Second, Queen Elizabeth II is still alive, so she hasn't been buried yet. Third, even if she were to be buried in the Pantheon, it's unlikely that we would know about it ahead of time, so it's hard to say for sure.",
