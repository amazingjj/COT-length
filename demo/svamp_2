We know 5 children is on the bus. second step,There were 63 children that got off the bus. third step, some more got on the bus we define as unknown x. fourth step, 14 children remained on the bus. we have equation x+5-63 = 14, now we know x is 72. fifth step, Therefore, 72 - 63 = 9. 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off.",
